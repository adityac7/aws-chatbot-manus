# Todo List for AWS Chatbot with Text-to-SQL Terraform Project

## Requirements Analysis
- [x] Analyze user requirements for chatbot with text-to-SQL capability
- [x] Identify appropriate AWS services for the solution
- [x] Document architecture overview in README.md

## Architecture Design
- [x] Design initial architecture for AWS resources
- [x] Update architecture for Parquet data format
- [x] Optimize architecture for performance and cost
- [x] Add conversation memory (30 per user) to architecture
- [x] Add support for 20 concurrent questions
- [x] Create and get approval for architecture diagram

## Terraform Resource Design
- [x] Design S3 bucket configuration for Parquet data storage
- [x] Design AWS Glue resources for data cataloging
- [x] Design Lake Formation for data governance
- [x] Design Amazon Athena resources for SQL querying
- [x] Design Amazon Bedrock integration for LLM capabilities
- [x] Design Lambda functions for query processing (with concurrency)
- [x] Design SQS for query queue management
- [x] Design DynamoDB for conversation history storage
- [x] Design Memory Manager Lambda for conversation context
- [x] Design ElastiCache for results caching
- [x] Design API Gateway for user interaction
- [x] Design CloudFront for content delivery
- [x] Design IAM roles and policies for secure access
- [x] Design Cognito resources for authentication
- [x] Design CloudWatch for monitoring and logging
