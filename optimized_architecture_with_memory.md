# Optimized AWS Chatbot Architecture with Memory and Concurrency

## Architecture Optimizations

### Data Format & Storage
- **Parquet Format**: Optimized columnar storage format for efficient querying
- **S3 Data Partitioning**: Data organized by logical partitions for query performance
- **Lake Formation**: Added for fine-grained access control and governance

### Scalability Enhancements (100+ Users)
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes API requests across multiple instances
- **Auto Scaling**: Dynamically adjusts compute resources based on demand
- **SQS Queue**: Decouples query processing from execution for better throughput
- **ElastiCache**: Caches frequent query results to reduce database load

### Conversation Memory
- **DynamoDB**: Stores last 30 conversations per user
- **Memory Manager Lambda**: Handles conversation history retrieval and storage
- **Context-aware Processing**: Incorporates conversation history into new queries

### Concurrency Support
- **Query Processing (20 Concurrent)**: Architecture designed to handle 20 concurrent questions
- **SQS Queue**: Manages concurrent query processing without performance degradation
- **Auto Scaling**: Scales resources based on concurrent request volume

### Performance Optimizations
- **Query Result Caching**: Reduces redundant processing for common queries
- **Athena Query Optimization**: Leverages Parquet's columnar format for faster analytics
- **CloudFront CDN**: Delivers UI assets with low latency globally

### Cost Optimizations
- **Serverless Architecture**: Pay-per-use model with Lambda functions
- **Caching Strategy**: Reduces repeated query execution costs
- **Parquet Compression**: Reduces storage costs and improves query performance
- **Auto Scaling**: Scales down during low-usage periods to minimize costs

## Data Flow
1. User submits natural language query through React UI
2. API Gateway routes request through load balancer
3. Query processor Lambda retrieves conversation history from DynamoDB
4. Query processor converts query to SQL using Bedrock with context from conversation history
5. Query is placed in SQS queue for processing
6. SQL executor Lambda runs optimized query against Athena
7. Athena queries Parquet data in S3 through Lake Formation
8. Results are formatted and cached for future similar queries
9. Memory manager stores the query and result in conversation history
10. Response is returned to user through API Gateway

## Monitoring & Security
- **CloudWatch**: Monitors performance metrics and logs
- **IAM & Lake Formation**: Provides fine-grained access control
- **Cognito**: Handles user authentication and authorization
