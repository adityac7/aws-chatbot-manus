# Detailed Implementation Plan: AWS Chatbot with Text-to-SQL Capability

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Infrastructure Components
- **Data Storage**: Amazon S3 for storing CSV files (5-10GB)
- **Data Cataloging**: AWS Glue for creating and maintaining schema
- **Query Engine**: Amazon Athena for SQL execution against the data
- **AI/ML Component**: Amazon Bedrock for text-to-SQL conversion
- **Compute**: AWS Lambda for orchestration and business logic
- **API Layer**: Amazon API Gateway for RESTful endpoints
- **Authentication**: Amazon Cognito for user management
- **Security**: IAM roles and policies for secure access
- **Frontend**: Simple React application for user interaction

### 1.2 Data Flow
1. User uploads CSV data to S3 bucket
2. AWS Glue crawler catalogs the data structure
3. User interacts with the chatbot UI
4. Natural language query is sent to API Gateway
5. Lambda function processes the query
6. Amazon Bedrock converts natural language to SQL
7. Athena executes the SQL against the data in S3
8. Results are returned to the user through the UI

## 2. Terraform Resources

### 2.1 S3 Configuration
- S3 bucket for CSV data storage
- Bucket policies for secure access
- Lifecycle policies for cost optimization

### 2.2 AWS Glue Resources
- Glue database to organize tables
- Glue crawler to automatically discover schema
- Glue catalog tables to represent CSV structure

### 2.3 Amazon Athena Setup
- Athena workgroup for query execution
- Query result location in S3
- Named queries for common operations

### 2.4 Amazon Bedrock Integration
- Bedrock model configuration (Claude or Titan)
- Prompt templates for text-to-SQL conversion
- API access configuration

### 2.5 Lambda Functions
- Query processor function (receives user query, sends to Bedrock)
- SQL executor function (runs SQL against Athena)
- Result formatter function (formats query results for UI)

### 2.6 API Gateway
- REST API with endpoints for:
  - Query submission
  - Data upload status
  - Authentication
  - Results retrieval

### 2.7 Authentication & Security
- Cognito user pool for authentication
- IAM roles for Lambda execution
- IAM policies for service access
- Security groups for network isolation

## 3. Basic UI Implementation

### 3.1 Frontend Technology
- React.js for UI framework
- AWS Amplify for authentication integration
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop compatibility

### 3.2 UI Components
- Login/Registration screen
- Data upload interface
- Chat interface for query input
- Results display with formatting options
- Simple data visualization for query results

### 3.3 Deployment
- Static website hosting on S3
- CloudFront distribution for content delivery
- Route 53 for custom domain (optional)

## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Set up S3, Glue, and Athena resources
- Implement basic IAM roles and policies
- Create initial Lambda function for testing

### Phase 2: AI Integration
- Configure Bedrock model access
- Implement text-to-SQL conversion logic
- Test with sample queries against real data

### Phase 3: API and Authentication
- Set up API Gateway endpoints
- Configure Cognito user pools
- Implement authentication flow

### Phase 4: UI Development
- Create React application structure
- Implement authentication UI
- Build chat interface and results display
- Connect to backend API

### Phase 5: Testing and Optimization
- End-to-end testing with sample data
- Performance optimization
- Security review
- Cost optimization

## 5. Cost Estimation

### Monthly Cost Factors
- S3 storage: ~$0.023 per GB (5-10GB = $0.12-$0.23)
- Athena queries: $5.00 per TB scanned
- Bedrock API: Varies by model and usage (~$0.01-$0.03 per 1K tokens)
- Lambda: Free tier covers 1M requests, then $0.20 per 1M
- API Gateway: $1.00 per million API calls
- Glue crawler: $0.44 per hour (minimal usage)

### Cost Optimization Strategies
- Compress CSV data to reduce storage and query costs
- Partition data in S3 to minimize Athena scan costs
- Implement caching for common queries
- Use reserved capacity where applicable

## 6. Deliverables

- Complete Terraform configuration files
- Variables file with customizable parameters
- Outputs file with important resource identifiers
- README with deployment instructions

### 6.2 UI Code
- React application source code
- Build scripts and configuration
- Integration with AWS services
- Responsive design for all devices

### 6.3 Documentation

- Deployment guide
- User manual
- Troubleshooting guide
- Cost optimization recommendations

## 7. Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Multi-language support
- Advanced data visualization
- Query history and favorites
- Scheduled queries and alerts
- Integration with business intelligence tools
